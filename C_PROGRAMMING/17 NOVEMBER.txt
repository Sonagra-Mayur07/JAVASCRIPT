	Algorithms : It is a process of following step-by-step is called Algorithms.

	Q 1) Create an Algorithm of making a Tea.

	Steps :

	Step 1 : Start the gas
	Step 2 : Take the Inputs, (container,water,tea,sugar,etc.)
	Step 3 : Process (Boiling)
	Step 4 : Check (If tea is good, then goto next step else goto step1)
	Step 5 : Output (Serve)
	Step 6 : Stop.

	Q 2) Create an Algorithm to take 2 inputs and add them.
            

step-1 start the programme
step-2 take a inputes number A and B
step-3 check the a  and b.if any else is desimle so it can not add.if both numbers are intiger so go to next                        step.otherwise start with intiger number
step-4  add  both inputes A and B
step-6  get the output
step-7 stop
