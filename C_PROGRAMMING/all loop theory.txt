              ***LOOP***

:- it is a specific task which repeats again and again is called a loop

   -in c programming,we have 3 types of loop.
    
    (1)while loop
    (2)do.while loop
    (3)for loop

   - 3 important facts in loop.

    (1)initialization
    (2)condition
    (3)updation

------------------(1) while loop--------------

   -it is called an entry controlled loop.

:- because the condition is checked first and
then the body is executed.


    *  no semi colon after while 
    *  if condition is false ,then loop will stop.

  syntax:=

           initialization;

            while(condition)
         {
             statement;
             updation;
          }

------------------(2)do whille loop-----------

     -it is called as exit controlled loop.
     -beacause the condition is checked at last
     -it executes the do block at least once,even if the condition is false.

    * semi colon after while condition 

syntax :-

        initialization;

         do
           {

                  statement;

                  updation;

            }
             while(condition);

------------------(3) for loop----------------

  - there is all in one line 

  syntax  :-

      for (initialization;condition;updation)

        {

               statement;

        }
